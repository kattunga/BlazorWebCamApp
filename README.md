# Blazor Web Camera Application Example
Here is a fun example of using camera in the ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly application.

Complete description of how it was created you can find in [my blog](https://romansimuta.com/)'s post [Using a web camera with fun filters in your ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly application](https://romansimuta.com/posts/using-a-web-camera-with-fun-filters-in-your-asp-net-core-blazor-webassembly-application/)

To run it, you must have .NET Core SDK 3.1 installed.

Use `dotnet run` to run the application or `dotnet build` to compile it.

Happy coding!
